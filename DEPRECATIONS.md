### Setting `cleanModePreprocessorSymbols` will no longer be supported

[preprocessorSymbols](https://aka.ms/algosettings#preprocessorSymbols) are now supported as a global setting and can be applied to buildModes using [Conditional Settings](https://aka.ms/algosettings#conditional-settings). Example:

```
"conditionalSettings": [
    {
        "buildModes": [ "Clean" ],
        "settings": {
            "preprocessorSymbols": [ "CLEAN21", "CLEAN22" ]

    }
]
```

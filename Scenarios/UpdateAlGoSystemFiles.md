# Update AL-Go system files

*Prerequisites: A completed [scenario 5](RegisterProductionEnvironment.md)*

1. Every time a CI/CD pipeline runs, it checks whether there are updates to AL-Go system files. AL-Go System files are scripts in the **.AL-Go folder** and workflows in the **.github folder**. Looking into the details of the Check for updates to Al-Go system files, usually looks like this

   ![CI/CD](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/assets/10775043/8322a06e-a270-4b6d-8d92-ccc547ca4555)

1. In VS Code, try to modify the **LocalDevEnv.ps1** file, **stage** the change, **commit** and **push**.

1. Now there is a difference. AL-Go doesnâ€™t support that anybody changes the AL-Go system files and will warn about these changes. The CI/CD pipeline, which kicked off when pushing the change, tells me about this.

1. To update the AL-Go system files using the Update AL-Go System Files workflow, you need to provide a secret called GHTOKENWORKFLOW. Please use [this walkthrough](./GhTokenWorkflow.md) to create this secret.

1. On github.com, under **Actions** in your project, select the **Update AL-Go system files** workflow and choose **Run workflow**. Leave the **Template Repository URL** blank and choose **Run workflow**.

   ![update](https://github.com/microsoft/AL-Go/assets/10775043/221e6aa1-27a8-47ea-b011-88bb6b7005b9)

1. Inspect the pull request and see that it indeed reverts your change to the `LocalDevEnv.ps1` file.

11. By default, this workflow will apply any updates to the **workflow files (in .github\\workflows)** or **system scripts (in .AL-Go)** from the template repository used to spin up the repository. If you want to change branch or template Url, you can specify the `templateUrl@branch` when you run the workflow.
